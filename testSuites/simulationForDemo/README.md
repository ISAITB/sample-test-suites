# Using simulation for demonstration purposes

This test suite illustrates how test cases can also be used to **demonstrate** how a protocol
is expected to work. It involves use of several **simulated actors** with exchanges using 
**imported resources** as inputs and outputs, as well as **simulated processing steps** to present
results.

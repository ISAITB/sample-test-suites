# XML validation with XML Schema

This test suite includes a simple test case that requests an **XML file** from the user and then proceeds
to validate it using an **XML Schema** that is included in the test suite, and **imported** 
before being referenced.

This test suite is the sample referenced from [Guide: Creating a test suite](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/docs/guides/latest/creatingATestCase/index.html).

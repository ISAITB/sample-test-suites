# Test suite presentation, test case groups and simulated exchanges

This example focuses on features that can be used to enhance a test suite’s **presentation**, enhancing testers’ **user experience**. Presentation features in use include test case **tags**, rich **documentation** and specific outcome **messages** for different test session results. In addition, this test suite defines test cases with **simulated exchanges** for illustration, which are moreover **grouped** to require that at least is executed, but allowing other simulation test cases to fail or be skipped. Although not the focus of this test suite, each test case proceeds to **validate XML content** using XML Schema and Schematron, the content either being retrieved via HTTP GET or, for the test cases based on simulated exchanges, provided as fixed inputs.

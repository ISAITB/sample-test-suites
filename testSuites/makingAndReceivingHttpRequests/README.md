# Making and receiving HTTP requests

This test suite includes test cases that **validate XML data** using **XML Schema**, provided via **user upload** (`interact` step) and via **HTTP POST** (`receive` step). An additional test case also makes a HTTP POST (`send` step) and validates characteristics of the received response.

This test suite is the sample referenced from [Guide: Basic test case messaging](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/docs/guides/latest/sendingAndReceivingContent/index.html).
